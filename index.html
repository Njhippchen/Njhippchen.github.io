        <h2>Problem statement: Calorie Count</h2>
        <p>
          One problem is my life is keeping track of my calorie count for the day. I would create an app where I could take a picture of the food or label on the back where it keeps all the information about the food and the app would keep track of the calories and the nutritional value. And at the end of the day, it will rate the food you ate and give you suggestions on what foods to eat next.
